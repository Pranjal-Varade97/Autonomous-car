# Autonomous-car
This Repository will contain detailed files to create Autonomous car.

<b>Introduction:</b>

In this project,we will be  working on implementation of data mining techniques to design a Autonomous Car.For that we will be using Sunfounder Smart Video Car Kit V2.0 for Raspberry Pi.We will Assemble the car, Set up the Raspberry pi and train a model for detection of road lane and traffic signs.


<b>Phase1: Assemble the Autonomous Car</b>

Sunfounder Smart Video Car Kit V2.0 for Raspberry Pi 
In this phase, we assmble the car kit for Reapberry pi.We attached the Rear wheels, Battery Holder, Motor Driver, PWM Driver, Robot HATS, Raspberry Pi, Front wheels and then Circuit building is done. After this we fixed a Camera.Links given below will show the images of assembling of the car.

Car Improvement suggestions:

1.The quality of car can be improved.   
2.The parts of the car are open.It must have some covering for the important parts.

<b>Phase2:Setting-Up Raspberry Pi</b>             
In this phase, set up of the raspberry pi is done.For setting up reaspberry pi you will need to follow the following steps.

Step 1: Download pre-configured raspbian OS image             
Step 2: Create SD card for Raspberry Pi using downloaded image                
Step 3: Connect to Raspberry Pi using VNC viewer                  
Step 4: Setup networks if needed            
Step 5: Update raspbian OS using terminal            

To connect raspberry pi using VNC viewer, we directly setup wi-fi using a mice, a keyboard and a monitor (HDMI) and Configure wi-fi setting like any other computer.
